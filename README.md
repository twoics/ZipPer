# ZipPer
Archive application
## What is it?
This application allows you to archive and unarchive files

## Download
If you just want to use the application, you can simply download the `ZipPerSetup.exe`, and install the application on your computer.  
You can download the release version here [ZipPerSetup](https://github.com/twoics/ZipPer/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  
> Download only the .exe file, you do not need the rest to work

## Working with code
If you want to work with the current code you need to do a few things

1. Install Python version 3.6.0
2. Install the fbs and create a project, instructions on how to do this [Official fbs tutorial](https://github.com/mherrmann/fbs-tutorial)  

In short, you need to enter some commands in the console, in the project directory:  
```
pip install fbs-tutorial
```

```
fbs startproject
```

```
fbs run
```
3. You need to replace the folder `src/main` folder of your project to mine [My main folder](https://github.com/twoics/ZipPer/tree/main/src/main)  
> Done! Now you can work with the current project
